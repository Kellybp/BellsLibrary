## Setup and Installation

   To use this sample application, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the solution in Visual Studio or your preferred IDE.
3. Set up API project:
    - Under `BellsLibrary/BellsLibrary.API.MVC`, update the database connection string in the `appsettings.json` file to point to your desired database.
    ```
    "ConnectionStrings": {
        "BellsLibrary": "<add your connection string>"
    }
    ```
    - Build the solution to restore NuGet packages and compile the code.
    - Run the database migrations to create the necessary tables and seed initial data.
    - Start the application `BellsLibrary/BellsLibrary.API.MVC`. This is a ASP.NET MVC Core Web API project. It will open up a swagger page where you can test the API endpoints.
4. Set up Blazor project:
    - Under `BellsLibrary/BellsLibrary.UI`, build the solution to restore NuGet packages and compile the code.
    - Make sure to update the API Url in appsettings.json file to point to the API project.
    ```
    "Api": {
        "Url": "https://localhost:7055"
    }
    ```
    - Under `BellsLibrary/BellsLibrary.UI`, update the database connection string in the `appsettings.json` file to point to your desired database.
    ```
    "ConnectionStrings": {
        "BellsLibraryContextConnection": "<add your connection string>"
    }
    ```
    - Start the application `BellsLibrary/BellsLibrary.UI`. This is a Blazor Server Web App project. It will open up a web page where you can interact with the application.
